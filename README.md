## Holiday Campaigns

For this project our group decided to make a website to show upcoming holidays to assist with marketing campaigns.

### Homepage

The homepage has a carousel with upcoming holidays, a button to start a new project, and a spot for projects saved by the user.

### Project Page

The project page has a lot more functionality allowing the user to make campaign projects associated with a hoilday of their choosing.

* There is a country selector that will show all the holidays in the selected country.

* The day selector will highlight the calander on the selected days for ease of reference.

* Any holiday on the calander can be clicked to show adidional info to the side aswell as a link to the relevant Wikipedia page.

* Reports can be saved by clicking the save report button which will save them to the project list on the main page.
